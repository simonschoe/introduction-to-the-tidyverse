## 4.3 `readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

`readr` provides read and write functions for multiple different file formats:
- `read_delim()`: general delimited files
- `read_csv()`: comma separated files
- `read_csv2()`: semicolon separated files
- `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
- `read_fwf()`: fixed width files
- `read_table()`: white-space separated files
- `read_log()`: web log files

Conveniently, the `write_*()` functions work analog. In addition, use the `readxl` package for Excel files, the `haven` package for Stata files, the `googlesheets4` package for Google Sheets or the `rvest` package for HTML files.

.footnote[
*Note: In most European countries Microsoft Excel is using `;` as the common delimiter, which can be accounted for by leveraging the `read_csv2()` function.*
]

???
- `read_delim()` as a generalization of the other functions
- `rvest` as the go-to package in the context of web scraping with `R`

## 4.3 `readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

Let's try it out by reading in the penguins data. For the purpose of illustrating the `readr` package, the `penguins` data is written to a csv-file a priori using `write_csv(penguins, file = "./data/penguins.csv")`.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Base Case]
```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Select Columns]
```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv", col_select = c(species, island))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Name Columns]
```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv", col_names = paste("Var", 1:8, sep = "_"))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Skip Rows]
```{r}
data <- read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv", skip = 5)
```
]
]

## 4.3 `readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data

`readr` prints the column specifications after importing. By default, it tries to infer the column type (e.g., `int`, `dbl`, `chr`, `fct`, `date`, `lgl`) from the first 1,000 rows and parses the columns accordingly using the built-in `parse_*()` functions.

Try to make column specifications explicit! You likely get more familiar with your data and see warnings if something changes unexpectedly.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Option 1]
```{r, eval=F}
read_csv(
  file = "./data/penguins.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    species = col_character(),
    year = col_datetime(format = "%Y"),
    island = col_skip())
  )
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Option 2]
```{r, eval=F}
read_csv(
  file = "./data/penguins.csv",
  col_types =  "_f?di"  # skip, factor, guess, double, integer, ...
  )
```
]
]

Parsing only the first 1,000 rows is efficient but can lead to erroneous guesses:
```{r, eval=F}
read_csv(file = "./data/penguins.csv", guess_max = 2000)
```

- Hint: sometimes you may have trouble when reading in text data (type character): special signs such as ö, ä or ü may be strangely encoded as cryptic symbols -> in those cases you must control for the encoding of your data in the read_csv function (e.g., UTF-8)

Eventually, you would want to cease using `.xlsx` and `.csv` files as they are not capable of reliably storing your metadata (e.g., data types).

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.height='60%', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/excel.jpg")

`write_rds()` and `read_rds()` provide a nice alternative for [serializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) your `R` objects (e.g., `tibbles`, models) and storing them as `.rds` files.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  write_rds(file = "./data/penguins.rds")
```

```{r}
penguins <- read_rds(file = "./data/penguins.rds")
```

<br>

Note that
- `write_rds()` can only be used to save one object at a time,
- a loaded `.rds` file must be stored into a new variable, i.e. given a new name,
- `read_rds()` preserves data types!

- serialization: the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored, transmitted and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).
