## Contents

This lecture teaches you important tools for working with tabular data sets in `R`. It introduces and showcases a suite of packages which ease your data science workflow in terms of data import, data cleaning, data transformation and data visualization.

More specifically, after this lecture you will
- be familiar with the main tools of the `tidyverse` and how it differs from `base R`,
- know your way around in working with the core packages of the `tidyverse` for importing, tidying, transforming and visualizing data,
- be proficient in processing (*non-tidy*) data of any shape and quality,
- be able to produce high-quality, fully customizable visualizations,
- have improved your overall data literacy.
